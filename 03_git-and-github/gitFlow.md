# Git Flow

- Estratégia para <b>melhorar organização de branches no repositório.</b>

## Main branches

### 1. Master

- Send commit of releases to deploy.

### 2. Develop

- Contain all stable features that will be merged into master.

## Support branches

### 1. Features

- For any new feature, a new branch is created.

### 2. Release

- Create a point were we wonder what we expect of a next project release.

### 3. Hotfix

- Fix a a bug in deploy, merged directly into master.
