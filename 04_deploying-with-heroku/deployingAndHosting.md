# Heroku, Deploying & Hosting

- Heroku is a <b>cloud hosting platform</b> as a service (PaaS) that has features for a developer to <b>build, run and scale applications.</b>

## Deploying

- <b>Deploy is making the application run 24/7 on a server host</b>.

## Hosting

- A <b>web hosting</b> is where all of your files will be stored to be served on a 24/7 machine.
- This machine can be _"rented"_ by web host servers, like hostgator, or you can setup your own machine.
- So you need to register a domain managed by _ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers)_ so you can <b>host your website with a web host service</b>.
- _See: [How domain registration work](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2235607/how-does-domain-registration-work)_

### <b>Common types of hosting</b>

#### Shared

- Most used, a single server is partitioned and you use a slice of that server.
- Best for beginners, portfolios, etc.

#### VPS (Virtual Private Service)

- Utilize a shared server environment, but running a virtualized server on top of it that you can allocate space, CPU usage, memory and more.
- It's like an shared server upgrade.

#### Dedicated

- A entire server for the website. Complete control over server environment and great perfomance.

#### Managed

- Access to a server managed and optimized for a certain type of website, like _WordPress managed hosting_. Wordpress is a CMS software (Content Management System) that helps the developer to build the website.

#### Cloud

- Blends both <b>shared and dedicated hosting together</b>.
- You don't rent space on a single physical server, <b>all your server hardware is virtual</b>.
- So if your site is malfunctioning, it can be switched to another virtual server.
