## Notes from the class

**API:** Application Programming Interface
* Interaces for code/computers to talk to one another.
* For example: Tinder uses Facebook API to retrieve interests of people (liked pages).

**Web API**: Web Interfaces

### Data formats

* When we use the internet, we make HTTP request and get _HTML_ back.
* API's don't respond with HTML.

> HTML: contains information about **structure** of the page <br>
> API's: respond with **data**, not structure.

* They use the simpler data formats: **JSON or XML**.

#### XML (Extended Markup Language):
* Similar to HTML, but it does **not describre presentation**.

#### JSON (JavaScrip Objetc Notation):
* Looks like JavaScript objects, but **everything is a string**.
* It's not exactly JavaScript, you need quotes around the keys.
